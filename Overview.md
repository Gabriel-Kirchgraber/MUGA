# MUGA Analysis
## Introduction
After experimenting with several mouse strains there is a strong possiblity that their response to an Oxalate-rich diet is influenced by genetic background.
To test this hypothesis we sent DNA for sequencing on the MiniMUGA array from Neogene. In this array 11255 SNPs are analysed and compared to reference genomes from a wide variety of mouse genomes. This enables us to check which background the mice have, and to detrmine its influence on experimental outcomes.

Martin Reichel conducted two experiments, MR42 and MR38. At the moment we analyze the data from Mr 42. IN this Experiment Il1A KO and IL1A WT mice were fed an oxalate rich diet over twelve days. Impact of the diet were evaluated by kidney morphology and weight loss.

Three WT mice were protected, two got ill. From the KO mice, two suffered more severe symptoms than the other three. After analysing the MUGA data for these mice, there seems to be a cluster of SNPs on chromosome 8 that only occurs in the protected WT genes.
## Experiment
### Restriction Fragment analysis (GK-01.10-Restriction_Fragment_Digest)
To check different mice for the presence of the cluster we are developing a restriction fragment digest to check for the presence of SNPs in the cluster. There are 18 SNPs that are characteristic for the cluster. Primers are designed to amplify the region around the SNP. The amplicon is digested with an enzyme which has its recognitiion site on the SNP. The digest is loaded on a gel and the presence or absence of the SNP is confirmed.
